# Traiter

A plant root system trait analyzer based on GiARoots

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2013 (I hope to port this to *nix soon though)
* OpenCV 2.4.9

## Setup

Make an environment variable named OPENCV_DIR and point it to [your OpenCV directory]/build/x64/vc12

## Usage

traiter [image_name]

## Usage Notes

Currently, the thresholding value is hardcoded to a reasonable default value, and the thresholding type is always set to standard thresholding.
